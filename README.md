Salesforce Assessment

When customer sign-up for community solar, they subscribe to one or more Shared Solar Systems via Subscriptions.

A Subscription can’t exist without a customer and it must always be linked to a Shared Solar System.
A customer can have multiple Subscriptions to multiple Shared Solar Systems. How would you model this relationship?
Subscriptions should not have overlapping effectivity dates for the same Shared Solar System. How would you ensure this doesn’t happen?
How would you track effectivity dates and statuses? How would you update the Shared Solar System with the currently effective Subscriptions?
